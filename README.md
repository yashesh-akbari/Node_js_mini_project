## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

Each project operates through a **CLI interface**. Here's a brief rundown of how each works:

1. **Calculator**: You input two numbers and an operation, and it will show you the result.
2. **Currency Converter**: You enter an amount in USD and the desired currency, and it will output the converted amount based on the latest exchange rates.
3. **File CRUD**: Use this to manage files, allowing you to create new files, read file content, update files, and delete files from the terminal.
4. **Joke Generator**: It fetches random jokes from an API and prints them to the console.
5. **To-Do List**: You can add new tasks, list your tasks, or remove completed ones, all from the terminal.
